# HR Data Analytics and Visualization

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **machine learning** and **data visualization** to enhance **Human Resource (HR) decision-making**. By analyzing HR datasets, building predictive models, and creating interactive dashboards, this solution provides actionable insights to improve employee retention and performance.



## Features

### Data Analysis & Preprocessing
- Analyzed a dataset of **10,000+ employee records**, including:
  - Demographics
  - Job details
  - Performance metrics
  - Turnover data
- Preprocessed data:
  - Handled missing values and outliers.
  - Engineered features like "years of service" and "performance improvement index."
  - Normalized and transformed data for better accuracy.

### Predictive Modeling
- Built **machine learning models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Achieved **95%+ accuracy** in predicting employee retention.
- Identified key factors influencing turnover and performance.

### Interactive Dashboards
- Created dashboards in **Power BI** for real-time insights.
- Visualizations include:
  - Employee turnover trends
  - At-risk employees
  - Correlations between education, performance, and retention


## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- **Visualization:** Power BI
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest



## Expected Outcomes 
- **Retention Impact:** Increased employee retention at least  **15%** through targeted strategies.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Enabled HR teams to address turnover risks and improve workforce performance.
